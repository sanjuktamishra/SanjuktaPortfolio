        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Sanjukta and I work for an MNC as a Sales Service Associate. I hold a Bachelor’s in Electronics (from Bangalore, India).
Since I was young, I have always enjoyed to visualize daily life information by drawing graphs and charts. And that’s how I look at data sets: to me it is one big information that i can visulize and make it easier for my orgnization to see results.
I have been working as a Sales Service Associate for more than 5 years with experience in Sales, Telecom and retail. I have worked on Power BI, Advanced Excel, Advanced SQl, ETLs, Tableau and Python (Pandas).</p>
